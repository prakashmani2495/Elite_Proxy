# Elite_Proxy
High level anonymous proxy(eliteproxy.py) scraper using Python 3x.


This is created for the intention of education purpose and don't be missuse it.

Functionalities:

Intially it will scrap the proxy from different free proxy providers like 'sslproxies.org', 'us-proxy.org', 'free-proxy-list.net' in a random manner and validate the scraped proxy for aliveness and high anonymity. If any proxy satisfies those conditions, it will return them in reusable format. My favourite part in this script is, it will iterate untill return a high anonymous proxy.
